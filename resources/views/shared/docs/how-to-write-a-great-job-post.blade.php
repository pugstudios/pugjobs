    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Title</strong>
            <p>Give your job post a title that sets it apart from others. Try to mention the language or technologies the job requires.</p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <ul>
                <li>What is the position all about?</li>
                <li>What are the intriguing aspects to the position?</li>
                <li>What will the candidate be responsible for?</li>
                <li>Will the candidate work with a great team or use some new tools?</li>
                <li>What is a list of skills that make sense considering the skill level of the candidate?</li>
                <li>What skills are mandatory?</li>
                <li>If there are secondary skills that you'd like candidates to have or to learn, how important are they?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salary</strong>
            <p>
                Even though it's not required, job seekers often only apply for jobs that are within their salary range. This saves both the 
                job seeker and the job poster from spending time on jobs that won't work for them.
